/**
 * An "alert" is the system's **primary** data structure. An "alert" is essentially
 * a collection of ```conditions``` which the backend monitors.
 *
 * All required properties must be present to create a new alert. Once an alert has been
 * created, the backend will "fill in" any omitted properties. For example, if you create
 * an alert without a ```publishers``` property, the backend will add the property and
 * assign an empty array. This applies to all component types.
 *
 * @typedef Alert
 * @type Object
 * @memberOf Schema
 *
 * @property {String=} alert_id - The alert's unique identifier (assigned by the backend, omit when creating a new alert).
 * @property {String=} template_id - The template identifier, if this alert was created from a template (otherwise null).
 * @property {String=} name - The name of the alert (if not provided, the backend will attempt to generate a name).
 * @property {String} user_id - The alert owner's unique identifier.
 * @property {String} alert_system - The alert owner's domain.
 * @property {Enums.AlertState=} alert_state - The alert's current status. Managed by the backend.
 * @property {Enums.AlertBehaviour=} alert_behaviour - The alert's strategy for handling state changes after its conditions are met â€”```terminate``` is the default value.
 * @property {String=} create_date - The time the alert was created (milliseconds since epoch). Managed by the backend.
 * @property {String=} last_start_date - The last time the alert was started (milliseconds since epoch). Managed by the backend.
 * @property {String=} last_trigger_date - The last time the alert was triggered (milliseconds since epoch). Managed by the backend.
 * @property {String=} user_notes - Ad hoc text.
 * @property {String=} alert_type - Used to classify the alert, controlling "default" publishing rules, if no publishers have been explicitly specified. This happens by matching the "active_alert_type" property of a {@link PublisherTypeDefault}.
 * @property {Array<Schema.Condition>} conditions - The conditions which cause an the alert to be triggered. If multiple conditions are present, they must all be satisfied before the alert will be triggered.
 * @property {Array<Schema.Publisher>=} publishers - The rules for sending notifications when the alert is triggered. This is optional. In most cases, it's best to rely on the default rules bound to the alert's owner.
 * @property {Array<Schema.Publisher>=} effectivePublishers - A read-only property added by the backend listing the "effective" rules which will be used to publish notifications. Any rules in the "publishers" property take precedence, then the default rules for the alert's owner are applied.
