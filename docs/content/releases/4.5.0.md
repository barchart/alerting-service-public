**New Features**

* Added "template" entities. Templates are used to define conditions (e.g. last price > $100) without reference to a specific target (e.g. Apple stock). Templates are intended to streamline user input (when multiple, similar alerts need to be created). To support these templates, three new functions were added â€” `AlertManager.retrieveTemplates`, `AlertManager.createTemplate`, `AlertManager.deleteTemplate`.
* Added a utility function, called `AlertManager.createAlertFromTemplate` to "merge" templates with targets (i.e. symbols), yielding an `Schema.Alert` object that can be saved.
