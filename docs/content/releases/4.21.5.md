**Technical Enhancements**

* Refactored the `AlertManager` class removing unnecessary promises from `async` functions.
* Refactored the `AdapterForHttp` class to use the `async/await` pattern.
* Refactored the `AdapterForSocketIo` class to use the `async/await` pattern.
* Refactored the `JwtProvider` class to use the `async/await` pattern.

**Bug Fixes**

* Corrected failure to update alert state in some cases when `AdapterForHttp` is used (e.g. expired > starting > expired).
