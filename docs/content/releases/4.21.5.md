**Bug Fixes**

* Corrected improper use of "creation" callback on alert subscriber initialization when using `AdapterForHttp` mode (the "mutation" callback is now correctly used for the first batch of alerts).
* Corrected improper use of "creation" callback on trigger subscriber initialization when using `AdapterForHttp` mode (the "mutation" callback is now correctly used for the first batch of triggers).
* Corrected improper use of "creation" callback on trigger template initialization when using `AdapterForHttp` mode (the "mutation" callback is now correctly used for the first batch of templates).
* Corrected failure to notify alert subscribers of state changes (in some cases) when `AdapterForHttp` is used (e.g. expired > starting > expired).

**Technical Enhancements**

* Refactored the `AlertManager` class removing unnecessary promises from `async` functions.
* Refactored the `AdapterForHttp` class to use the `async/await` pattern.
* Refactored the `AdapterForSocketIo` class to use the `async/await` pattern.
* Refactored the `JwtProvider` class to use the `async/await` pattern.

**Other**

* Fixed failure of example page to display toast when multiple alerts trigger simultaneously (and the `AdapterForHttp` is used).
